                                                        :words ()  
                                                       },  
                                             :negative {  
                                                        :score 1,  
                                                        :comparative 0.25,  
                                                        :words (mad)  
                                                       }  
                                             }
```
Sentiment analysis attempts to determine the affective state of the
speaker or the writer. The default implementation returns an
[EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) map of this analysis. The `:score`
represents the number of emotive words in the text while the
`:comparative` rates the occurrence of these words with regards to the
length of the text. The nested values (i.e. those under `:positive` and
`:negative` ) provide a list of matched `:words` and take only into account
their respective affectivity. The top level values incorporate both
affective states â€“ returning negative values for texts with overall negative
affects and positive values for texts with overall positive affects.
